        I was always a very curious kid, and that curiosity got me to fall in love with music from an early age. I remember hearing my older sister play the violin first, and being the copycat I was, I wanted to play the violin too.
        As I grew older, I became even more of a geek about it. I was enamored by all the music that was out there to play, and all the music that had yet to be written. I loved the idea that you can help people feel emotions through sound.
        I was crazy enough to try to do this violin thing professionally! After all, we're told to go for a job that doesn't feel like work, right?

        Fast forward to recent times, and I felt ready to add a new challenge in my life, but I didn't know what. A friend introduced this thing to me called coding, and being the curious cat that I am, I dove into it more deeply.
        I found out that I could be the one helping create applications that people actually use! I thought to myself, "Making music with a violin is cool, and so is making software with computers and other people! Why not do both!?"
        </p>
        That led me to pursue studying full-stack software engineering, which is where I am today.
