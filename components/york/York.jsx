        So how did I get to become a software engineer? Well, I was always a very curious kid and I spent a lot of time in front of computers. I liked tweaking anything I could so that I could test what programs could do, and see everything that was possible.
        I was fascinated with the way humans could speak to technology and make things come to life. That Pokemon page I made on Geocities back in the late 90s is a fond memory of mine. I had a lot of coder in me, but I didn't know it yet.

        My first love and my forever love, is being a musician. When I was 7, I heard my sister practicing violin all the time. Being the copycat younger sibling that I was, I begged my parents to let me learn the violin too. There was something about playing an instrument that drew my attention immediately.
        I always listened to music and tried fitting it into some imaginary story I was making up in my head. It amazed me how a wooden box with some strings and a bow had so much potential to make people feel emotions.
        </p>
        I was crazy enough to want to do it professionally. Spending hours in a practice room and diving deep into the music was something that never felt like work. After all, we're supposed to try to find work that doesn't feel like work, right?
        <p>
        I had spent thousands of hours practicing, rehearsing, and performing for the next 15 years or so. I had fulfilled a lot of dreams, but I reached a point where I felt ready to do something different, but I wanted to do something that could also connect with people and make an impact.
        A friend introduced coding to me. I sort of had an idea what it was, and had heard the words "JavaScript" and "Python" before, but I didn't know what they meant. Being the curious cat that I am, I investigated.
        </p>
        <p>
        The more investigating I did, the more I kept going down the rabbit hole of web development. I spent hours and hours on YouTube and Udemy, learning all that I could, being fascinated by the world of technology. Once I realized that I was doing this for fun, I knew I had found the right thing in software engineering.
        I enrolled in a full-stack software engineering bootcamp with Hack Reactor to further develop my skills, and the rest is history.

        When I'm not coding or playing the violin, you might find me doing one of the following:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc">
        <li>Goofing off with my dog, Onyx</li>
        <li>Caring too much about sports teams that I've rooted for since I was a kid</li>
        <li>Playing video games and board games with my friends</li>
        <li>Geeking out over anything from Star Wars and Marvel</li>
        <li>Taking pictures of all the food that I eat</li>
        <li>Looking for beautiful places around the world to travel to</li>
        </ul>
